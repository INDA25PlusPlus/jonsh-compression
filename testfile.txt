I told myself it was just a cube. Plastic. Colored stickers. A children’s toy. That’s how it started—by belittling it, by reducing it to something beneath me. I am Jonathan Hane. I solve problems. I untangle systems. I do not lose to objects that fit in the palm of my hand.

The first turns were casual, almost bored. White face first, because that’s what you’re supposed to do. Edges, corners, patterns I half-remembered from some tutorial I watched years ago and never needed again. My hands moved while my mind wandered. I was thinking about how strange it is that people anthropomorphize failure, how they say a thing “refuses” to work, as if the universe itself were stubborn. The cube clicked softly, obediently. For a while, it agreed with me.

Then it didn’t.

Somewhere between solving the second layer and destroying it again by accident, something shifted. I noticed the silence. Not the peaceful kind—the kind that presses inward, that makes you aware of your own breathing, your pulse, the faint ringing in your ears. I realized I had been holding the cube for a long time. Longer than intended. My thumbs were sore. I hadn’t blinked in a while.

It was still just a cube, I told myself. But it had begun to feel like a record of my mistakes. Every wrong turn preserved in bright, undeniable color. I would fix one side and ruin another. Progress demanded sacrifice. Order required destruction elsewhere. That felt… familiar.

I laughed at that thought, a short, sharp sound that startled me. “Don’t be dramatic,” I said aloud, to no one. The cube answered with another click.

Patterns emerged, not the helpful kind, but the mocking kind. Almost-solved faces. Near-perfect alignments that collapsed the moment I touched them. I started narrating my moves under my breath, as if language itself could impose discipline on chaos. Right face up. Top layer left. No, no—undo that. Undo it. Why doesn’t it go back the way it was?

Because it never does, Jonathan. Nothing ever does.

That was the first time I used my own name as an accusation.

My thoughts began looping. I would catch myself staring at the same configuration I’d seen ten minutes earlier, certain I had already tried this path, already failed here. Time flattened. The cube became the only object in the world with mass and weight. Everything else—room, walls, life beyond this moment—felt theoretical.

My ego, that quiet assumption of competence I carried everywhere, started to crack. I was supposed to be good at this. People like me are good at puzzles. That’s part of the contract. And yet here I was, reduced to brute force intuition, twisting plastic and hoping.

The cube was teaching me something I didn’t want to learn: that understanding is not the same as control.

My hands moved faster, more aggressively. The clicks grew louder, harsher. I stopped caring about elegance or method. I just wanted it done. I wanted proof that I was still who I thought I was. Each failure felt personal, targeted. As if the cube knew me. As if it had mapped my impatience, my need to dominate, and arranged itself accordingly.

My breath became shallow. My vision tunneled. Colors blurred at the edges, bleeding into one another. I remember thinking, absurdly, that this must be what people mean when they talk about madness—not delusions or voices, but fixation. The inability to let go.

I tried to stop. I really did. I set the cube down once, hands trembling, only to snatch it back seconds later, terrified that pausing meant surrender. Who was I if I walked away unsolved?

Thoughts dissolved into noise. I wasn’t Jonathan Hane anymore. I was a pair of hands and a problem. No past. No future. Just permutations. Just endless wrongness.

And then something broke.

Not the cube. Me.

The realization arrived without drama: I was not in control. I never had been. The cube didn’t owe me obedience. The universe didn’t care about my self-image. My intelligence, my pride, my narrative about who I was—none of it mattered here. I felt it fall away, layer by layer, like faces of the cube stripping down to raw mechanism.

There was grief in that. And relief.

I stopped forcing solutions. I stopped trying to win. I simply observed. I noticed relationships instead of outcomes. This piece moves that one. This loss enables that gain. I accepted temporary disorder. I let sides be unsolved without panicking.

My hands slowed. My breathing deepened. The noise in my head faded, replaced by a quiet, almost reverent focus. I wasn’t trying to prove anything anymore. I was just… participating.

And then, without fanfare, it happened.

One layer aligned. Then another. No rush. No triumph. Just inevitability. The final turn was gentle. The cube clicked into completeness, all faces solid, calm, undeniable.

I stared at it for a long time.

I didn’t feel victorious. I felt empty, in the clean way that follows a storm. Solving it hadn’t restored my ego. It had dissolved it. I wasn’t smarter than the cube. I wasn’t lesser, either. I was simply a mind that had learned to stop fighting reality long enough to understand it.

My name came back to me slowly.

Jonathan Hane.

I set the cube down, solved and silent, and for the first time since I’d picked it up, I didn’t feel the urge to touch it again.
